## Introduction:
The computer vision and robotics communities, with the increasing performance of machine learning techniques in the last few years, have created a large number of datasets for benchmarking object recognition tasks. These datasets cover a large spectrum of natural images and object categories. In domestic environments, an autonomous robot faces the challenge of recognizing a large variety of everyday objects such as groceries. This task is challenging due to the large variety of objects and products.

## Problem statement:
To achieve better performance in classifying grocery items by using convolutional neural networks.

> Data: Freiburg Groceries Dataset
Dataset of grocery sold online such as beans, corn, milk etc. The dataset includes around 5000 images which are divided into 25 classes (beans, corn and milk are example of 3 classes) with at least 97 images per class.

## Conclusion: 
A learning curve is always available and this project has helped me gain much more than coding skills (which I am still learning) but a clear picture of how CNN will not get its accuracy. I will now try to tweak this further and update all the readers on how to get accuracy on this type of dataset using CNN.
To facilitate comparison, I provide results averaged over five train/test splits using a standard deep network architecture, which achieved a mean accuracy of 51.9%overall classes. I believe that the Freiburg Groceries Dataset represents an interesting and challenging benchmark to evaluate state of-the-art object recognition techniques such as deep neural networks. Moreover, I believe that this real-world training data is a valuable resource for accelerating a variety of service robot applications and assistive systems where the ability to recognize everyday objects plays a key role. One big challenge is the large resources needed to run such models.
